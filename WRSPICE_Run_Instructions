Commands for plotting each circuit as shown in the paper (some accelerators, like the racetree, require in-circuit modifications to match the desired input times):

To start WRSPICE:
BASH COMMANDS

export wrspice=/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/bin/wrspice
$wrspice -m /usr/local/xictools/wrspice.current/devkit/examples/jj/module_dist/jj.so



With WRSPICE Running:
Use GUI to select .cir file. Double-click. 

*NOTE 1: Some circuits use variables that aren't recognized by WRSPICE on the first double-click, which may show up in a warning window. Dismiss the window and double-click on the circuit again.

*NOTE 2: The same 2x double-click must be repeated each time the circuit is modified and re-simulated or if it is re-selected after choosing another circuit.


In WRSPICE Unix-like Interface, type the following commands (unique to each circuit):

For Delay:
run
plot v(JTL1) v(JTL2) v(JTL3) v(JTL4)


For Inhibit:
run
plot v(a) v(b) v(OUT)


For Last Arrival:
run
plot v(IN1) v(IN2) v(OUT)


For Coincidence:
run
plot v(IN1) v(IN2) v(CLK) v(OUT)


For FA_stateful:
run
plot v(IN1) v(IN2) v(CLK) v(OUT)


For FA_stateless:
run
plot v(IN1) v(IN2) v(OUT)


For Delay Function:
run
plot v(IN1) v(IN2) v(IN3) v(OUT1) v(OUT2) v(OUT3) v(FIRST)


For racetree (camera-ready version with additional pulse-shaping):
run
plot v(REF) v(IN1) v(IN2) v(UB) v(OUTA) v(OUTB) v(OUTC) v(OUTD)


For DNA, gat-act (both stateful and stateless ("nos") versions):
run
plot v(IN1) v(DEL11) v(MATCH21) v(INS32) v(MATCH33) v(MATCH44)


For DNA, act-act (both stateful and stateless ("nos") versions):
run
plot v(IN1) v(MATCH11) v(MATCH22) v(MATCH33) v(MATCH44)
